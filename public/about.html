<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Ivis Perdomo. I am a 24 year old currently living in New York. I graduated from Binghamton University in 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I went back to school in 2023 at Western Governors University to persue a B.S. in Software Engineering. Now, I am currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technology for a M.S. in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I built a portfolio website so that I can have my previous projects on showcase for future positions.</p>

<p>My goal is to seek a Software Engineer role at a company where my skills will be fully utilized, but I also seek a position where I can learn and continue to develop.</p>
