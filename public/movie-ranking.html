  <h1>The Best Movies According to Ivis</h1>

  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

  <hr />

  <h3>Spider-Man 2</h3>
  <p>Spider-Man hands down has to be my favorite movie character, and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man trilogy is my favorite of the three Spider-Man reboots. Tobey's acting and the storyline of Spider-Man 2 make it my favorite movie all time.</p>

  <h3>Transformers</h3>
  <p>One of the best sci-fi movies in my opinion at the time. The concept of alien robots disguised as vehicles who could talk and fight each other was an intriging concept to me. The follow-up movies, besides Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, cannot compare to the original.</p>

  <h3>You Don't Mess with the Zohan</h3>
  <p>I had to sneak in a funny movie here, and Adam Sandler plays his role perfectly.</p>
